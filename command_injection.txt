Command injection is an attack in which the goal is execution of
arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable
application.

Application passes unsafe user supplied data (forms, cookies, HTTP headers etc.to a system shell

The attacker extends
the default functionality of the application, which execute system
commands, without the necessity of injecting code.
